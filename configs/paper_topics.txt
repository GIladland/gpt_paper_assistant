 1. Semantic Decoding, using EEG, MEG or fMRI to convert brain activity into continous language output
    - Relevant: papers that discuss brainâ€“computer interface implementations, representation of brain content, and brain decoding in general.
    - Not relevant: papers that doesn't have interesting results.
 2. Brain deocding of visual stimuli, speech or any other modality
    - Relevant: Papers that are serious with good results for practical brain decoding
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not use deep learning, transformers or other modern deep learning architectures.
 3. NeuroAI papers that deals with the relation between Machine Learning models and brain networks
    - Relevant: papers that study the relation between brains and AI
    - Not relevant: Papers that only deal with brain and AI comparison superficially.

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on the relation between AI and brain
 Your friend also likes learning about brain decoding and insights into neuroscientific issues while utilizing deep learning, transformers, convolutions and modern machine learning models.
